# csv-reader

[![npm Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/csv-reader.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/csv-reader)

A CSV stream reader, with many many features, and ability to work with the largest datasets

## Included features: (can be turned on and off)

* Support for excel-style multiline cells wrapped in quotes
* Choosing a different delimiter instead of the comma
* Automatic skipping empty lines
* Automatic skipping of the first header row
* Automatic parsing of numbers and booleans
* Automatic trimming
* Being a stream transformer, you can `.pause()` if you need some time to process the row and `.resume()` when you are ready to receive and process more rows.
* Consumes and emits rows one-by-one, allowing you to process datasets in any size imaginable.
* Automatically strips the BOM if exists (not handled automatically by node.js stream readers)

## Installation:

```
npm install --save csv-reader
```

The options you can pass are:

Name | Type      | Default | Explanation
---- |-----------|---------| -----------
  `delimiter` | `String`  | `,`     | The character that separates between cells 
  `multiline` | `Boolean` | `true`  | Allow multiline cells, when the cell is wrapped with quotes ("...\n...") 
  `allowQuotes` | `Boolean` | `true`  | Should quotes be treated as a special character that wraps cells etc.
  `skipEmptyLines` | `Boolean` | `false` | Should empty lines be automatically skipped?
  ~~`skipHeader`~~ | `Boolean` | `false` | Should the first header row be skipped? (*Deprecated*, please use `skipLines`)
  `skipLines` | `Number`  | `0`     | Number of lines to skip (if `skipHeader` is `true`, then this gets +1) (after the header line if `headerLine` is set)
  `headerLine` | `Number` | `0`     | Line number of the header (`skipLines` will be lines skipped after the header line)
  `asObject` | `Boolean` | `false` | If true, each row will be converted automatically to an object based on the header. This adds `1` to `skipLines`.
  `parseNumbers` | `Boolean` | `false` | Should numbers be automatically parsed? This will parse any format supported by `parseFloat` including scientific notation, `Infinity` and `NaN`.
  `parseBooleans` | `Boolean` | `false` | Automatically parse booleans (strictly lowercase `true` and `false`)
  `ltrim` | `Boolean` | `false` | Automatically left-trims columns
  `rtrim` | `Boolean` | `false` | Automatically right-trims columns
  `trim` | `Boolean` | `false` | If true, then both 'ltrim' and 'rtrim' are set to true
  
## Events:

A `'data'` event will be emitted with each row, either in an array format (`(string|number|boolean)[]`) or an Object format (`Object<string, (string|number|boolean)>`), depending on the `asObject` option.  
A preliminary `'header'` event will be emitted with the first row, only in an array format, and without any interpolation to different types (`string[]`).  
Of course other events as usual - `end` and `error`.

## Usage example:

```javascript

const Fs = require('fs');
const CsvReadableStream = require('csv-reader');

let inputStream = Fs.createReadStream('my_data.csv', 'utf8');

inputStream
	.pipe(new CsvReadableStream({ parseNumbers: true, parseBooleans: true, trim: true }))
	.on('data', function (row) {
	    console.log('A row arrived: ', row);
	})
	.on('end', function () {
	    console.log('No more rows!');
	});

```

A common issue with CSVs are that Microsoft Excel for some reason *does not save UTF8 files*. Microsoft never liked standards.
In order to automagically handle the possibility of such files with ANSI encodings arriving from user input, you can use the [autodetect-decoder-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autodetect-decoder-stream) like this:

```javascript

const Fs = require('fs');
const CsvReadableStream = require('csv-reader');
const AutoDetectDecoderStream = require('autodetect-decoder-stream');

let inputStream = Fs.createReadStream('my_data.csv')
	.pipe(new AutoDetectDecoderStream({ defaultEncoding: '1255' })); // If failed to guess encoding, default to 1255

// The AutoDetectDecoderStream will know if the stream is UTF8, windows-1255, windows-1252 etc.
// It will pass a properly decoded data to the CsvReader.
 
inputStream
	.pipe(new CsvReadableStream({ parseNumbers: true, parseBooleans: true, trim: true }))
	.on('data', function (row) {
	    console.log('A row arrived: ', row);
	}).on('end', function () {
	    console.log('No more rows!');
	});
	
```
